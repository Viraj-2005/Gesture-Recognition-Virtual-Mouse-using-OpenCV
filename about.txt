**********Gesture Recognition Virtual Mouse using Opencv**********

The "Gesture Recognition Virtual Mouse" project aims to create a seamless
interaction between users and their devices through hand gestures. By leveraging
computer vision and machine learning techniques, this project transforms hand
movements into mouse actions, allowing users to control their computer without   
physical contact with a mouse. This can enhance accessibility and offer a novel way
of interacting with technology.
